https://quicksearch.dla.mil/qsDocDetails.aspx?ident_number=205530

The AsciiDoc template provided is based on the Software Development Plan (SDP) Data Item Description (DID) DI-IPSC-81427, which is a standard used by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) for documenting software development plans.

The latest revision of this DID, identified as DI-IPSC-81427, was published on March 13, 2017, and is currently active. This version supersedes the previous revision, DI-IPSC-81427A, which was approved on January 10, 2000.


This template aligns with the structure and content outlined in the 2017 revision of the SDP DID. It includes sections such as Introduction, Referenced Documents, Software Development Overview, Software Development Environment, Software Development Process, Project Management, Supporting Processes,
and Appendices, which are consistent with the requirements specified in the DID.

Further customization or additional details can be added to tailor the template to your specific project needs.

=== Executive Summary

The purpose of this Software Development Plan (SDP) is to define the strategy, processes, tools, and resources that will guide the development, integration, testing, and delivery of the software product throughout its life cycle. This document provides a comprehensive framework for managing and executing the software development effort in accordance with project objectives, contractual obligations, and applicable standards.

The SDP outlines the development approach, organizational roles and responsibilities, development environment, quality assurance practices, configuration management processes, and risk mitigation strategies. It serves as a key communication tool among stakeholders and ensures a shared understanding of how the software will be engineered to meet performance, schedule, and quality requirements.

By documenting the planned technical and managerial processes, the SDP supports transparency, facilitates oversight, and promotes consistency, traceability, and accountability across the software life cycle.

=== 1.1 Purpose
Describe the purpose of the SDP, including its intended audience and scope.

The purpose of the Software Development Plan (SDP) described in DI-IPSC-81427 (and its updates) is to:
‚úÖ Define How Software Will Be Developed, Integrated, and Delivered

It provides a comprehensive plan for managing, conducting, and controlling the software development effort throughout the software life cycle.
üß© Key Objectives of the SDP:

    Establish the Development Strategy
    Describes the life cycle model (e.g., Agile, Waterfall) and how it will be applied to the project.

    Define Processes, Methods, and Tools
    Explains how requirements, design, coding, integration, testing, and delivery will be performed.

    Coordinate Teams and Responsibilities
    Identifies the organizational structure, roles, and responsibilities for software development.

    Support Project Management
    Provides the basis for planning, scheduling, resource allocation, and tracking progress.

    Communicate with Stakeholders
    Serves as a communication tool between developers, managers, customers, and other stakeholders.

    Ensure Compliance
    Helps ensure that the software development effort complies with contractual, regulatory, and quality requirements (especially important in government and defense projects).

    Manage Risks and Issues
    Identifies risks related to software development and outlines mitigation strategies.

üîç In the Context of DoD or Government Contracts:

In government programs (especially DoD), the SDP is a contractually required deliverable, used by acquisition and oversight personnel to evaluate and monitor the contractor's software development effort.
